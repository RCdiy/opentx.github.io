title: "Thank you Bertand, and also to the rest of the team - fantastic job with 2.2.1! I think I should say that OpenTx has been an absolute godsend for many like myself who fly F3X gliders, it's opened up all kinds of exciting avenues (latest project is Lua based snapflap mix for ultimate in-flight adjustability). I really cannot imagine going back to another system - OpenTX is simply the best. Keep up the great work and seasons greetings"

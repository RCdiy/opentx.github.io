OpenTX Companion and firmware are now available as version 2.0.1.

Download and install Companion and use it to retrieve and transfer the latest OpenTX firmware to your radio.

Please note that the 2.0 branch of OpenTX is not yet "stable". Its features are still subject to changes in behavior, and some may added or removed in future updates which means it is essential to follow the release notes between versions to avoid surprises, and as it is not fully documented you might need to turn to forums for support. We recommend the general public to stay with the current stable version (companion9x v.1.52 and OpenTX firmware r2940). Switching to the 2.0 branch is only recommended for advanced users who want to be ahead of the curve and give feedback, or desperately need one of the new features and are ready to give away some stability for it.

The OpenTX team always encourages upgrading to the latest version of a given branch, but no security problems have been found in version 2.0.0 that make it necessary to update.

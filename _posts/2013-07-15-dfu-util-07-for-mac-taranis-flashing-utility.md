Note that OpenTX 2.2 includes dfu-util and avrdude in its .app package (companion 2.2.app/Contents/Resources/dfu-util) and this installer is no longer needed.

Flashing utility for the Taranis on Mac OS X.  
* Download and install
* Make sure that in OpenTX Companion's Burn Preferences (OpenTX Companion menu -> Preferences) the dfu-util path is set to "/opt/local/bin/dfu-util".
* Dismiss with OK, and you should now be able to flash.

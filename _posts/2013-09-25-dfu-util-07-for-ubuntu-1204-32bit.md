* Download the package.
* First uninstall the existing dfu-util if your system has an old version.
* Install the package.
* Make sure that in OpenTX Companion's Burn Preferences (OpenTX Companion menu -> Preferences) the dfu-util path is set to "/usr/bin/dfu-util".
* Dismiss with OK.

You should now be able to flash.
